# About The Project

This project is a web application created using React that displays Jobs from ZipRecruiter API depending on what user enters in Job Title and Location.

## Built With
* React
* React Bootstrap

# Getting Started

How to run your project locally.
You will need node and npm installed on your system.

## Prerequisites
* npm 
`npm install npm@latest -g`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
    `git clone https://github.com/isukhii/job-listing.git`

2. Install NPM packages
    `npm install`

## Build 
Run `npm start` to build the project. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Other Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


# Usage

1. To search for a job, enter Job Title, example `Perl` or `Python` and Location(city name and state in the fields), example: `Santa Monica, CA` or `London, UK`, and press on `Find Job` button

2. List of jobs will be displayed. To view more jobs click use pagination at the end of the page.
